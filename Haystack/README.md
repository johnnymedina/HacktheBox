#Haystack
Haystack is a simple box with bit of a sticky point in finding and translating information through the mess. 

####Kickoff
I started with an nmap scan of the systems to see what services were avaiable


Next, I used dirb to see what was running on the webservices on port 80 and 9200 identified.
